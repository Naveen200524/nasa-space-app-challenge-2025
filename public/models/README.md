Place your 3D planet models here.

Expected filenames (you can change later if needed, but also update js/PlanetCarousel.js):
- earth.glb (or earth.gltf)
- mars.glb (or mars.gltf)
- moon.glb (or moon.gltf)

Public URLs (served from project root):
- /public/models/earth.glb
- /public/models/mars.glb
- /public/models/moon.glb

Tips:
- Prefer GLB with embedded textures for simpler deployment.
- Keep file sizes small for faster load (consider Draco/Meshopt compression if large).
- Orient models so +Y is up and +Z forward if possible. Scale will be normalized at runtime.
